# Parking-Violation-Predictor-MLProject-

In the city of New York, The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC (~10M per year!). This data is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers. Some inspirations include:

-When are tickets most likely to be issued? Any seasonality?
-Where are tickets most commonly issued?
-What are the most common years and types of cars to be ticketed?

This project is about training a model on big data and predicting Violation locations using New York parking violations data.

Build the machine learning model. Choose the right algorithms to predict violation locations. Data preprocessing is needed. Apply containerisation principles as a better software engineering practice. With the help of spark streaming, predict streamed data. You may explore Kafka server for streaming the data.

The model can be deployed using Docker containers for scalability.

Dataset: New York parking violations (2017)

Approach:
-Extraction of data, Feature Engineering, Data Augmentation (if required), application of machine learning model, validation, deployment on container.
